.SH NAME
.PP
kubeadm completion \- Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh)


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubeadm completion\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh).
The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive
completion of kubeadm commands. This can be done by sourcing it from
the .bash\_profile.

.PP
Note: this requires the bash\-completion framework.

.PP
To install it on Mac use homebrew:
    $ brew install bash\-completion
Once installed, bash\_completion must be evaluated. This can be done by adding the
following line to the .bash\_profile
    $ source $(brew \-\-prefix)/etc/bash\_completion

.PP
If bash\-completion is not installed on Linux, please install the 'bash\-completion' package
via your distribution's package manager.

.PP
Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
