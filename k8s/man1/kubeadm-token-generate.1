kubeadm token generate \- Generate and print a bootstrap token, but do not create it on the server


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubeadm token generate\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command will print out a randomly\-generated bootstrap token that can be used with
the "init" and "join" commands.

.PP
You don't have to use this command in order to generate a token. You can do so
yourself as long as it is in the format "[a\-z0\-9]{6}.[a\-z0\-9]{16}". This
command is provided for convenience to generate tokens in the given format.

You can also use "kubeadm init" without specifying a token and it will
generate and print one for you.
