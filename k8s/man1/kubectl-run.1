.SH NAME
.PP
kubectl run \- Run a particular image on the cluster


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubectl run\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Create and run a particular image, possibly replicated.

.PP
Creates a deployment or job to manage the created container(s).


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-missing\-template\-keys\fP=true
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.

.PP
\fB\-\-attach\fP=false
    If true, wait for the Pod to start running, and then attach to the Pod as if 'kubectl attach ...' were called.  Default false, unless '\-i/\-\-stdin' is set, in which case the default is true. With '\-\-restart=Never' the exit code of the container process is returned.

.PP
\fB\-\-cascade\fP=true
    If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true.

.PP
\fB\-\-command\fP=false
    If true and extra arguments are present, use them as the 'command' field in the container, rather than the 'args' field which is the default.

.PP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fP=false
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.

.PP
\fB\-\-env\fP=[]
    Environment variables to set in the container

.PP
\fB\-\-expose\fP=false
    If true, a public, external service is created for the container(s) which are run

.PP
\fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-filename\fP=[]
    to use to replace the resource.

.PP
\fB\-\-force\fP=false
    Only used when grace\-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.

.PP
\fB\-\-generator\fP=""
    The name of the API generator to use, see 
\[la]http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-conventions/#generators\[ra] for a list.

.PP
\fB\-\-grace\-period\fP=\-1
    Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when \-\-force is true (force deletion).

.PP
\fB\-\-hostport\fP=\-1

.PP
\fB\-\-image\fP=""

.PP
\fB\-\-leave\-stdin\-open\fP=false

.PP
\fB\-\-limits\fP=""
    The resource requirement limits for this container.  For example, 'cpu=200m,memory=512Mi'.  Note that server side components may assign limits depending on the server configuration, such as limit ranges.
