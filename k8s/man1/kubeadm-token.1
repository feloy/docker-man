.SH NAME
.PP
kubeadm token \- Manage bootstrap tokens


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBkubeadm token\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command manages bootstrap tokens. It is optional and needed only for advanced use cases.

.PP
In short, bootstrap tokens are used for establishing bidirectional trust between a client and a server.
A bootstrap token can be used when a client (for example a node that is about to join the cluster) needs
to trust the server it is talking to. Then a bootstrap token with the "signing" usage can be used.
bootstrap tokens can also function as a way to allow short\-lived authentication to the API Server
(the token serves as a way for the API Server to trust the client), for example for doing the TLS Bootstrap.

.PP
What is a bootstrap token more exactly?
 \- It is a Secret in the kube\-system namespace of type "bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token".
 \- A bootstrap token must be of the form "[a\-z0\-9]{6}.[a\-z0\-9]{16}". The former part is the public token ID,
   while the latter is the Token Secret and it must be kept private at all circumstances!
 \- The name of the Secret must be named "bootstrap\-token\-(token\-id)".
